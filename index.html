<p>Fully compatible with WordPress 3.9, you can now easily embed all of your broadcasts without much effort at all. Just copy and paste a URL, and you're basically done.</p>

<p>Just download the plugin as a ZIP file and upload it - that's all there is to it. We'll release it on the WordPress Repository if we feel that you would like that.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>Dean Papastrat (<a href="https://github.com/deanpapastrat" class="user-mention">@deanpapastrat</a>) made this plugin after finding it difficult to properly integrate High School Cube with WordPress without continually pasting iframe after iframe, so he made a plugin to make it easier. He continues to develop it. He enjoys hiking and video games in his free time.</p>
